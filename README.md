# Algorithms Collection

This project contains implementations of classic search and sorting algorithms in C++. It is organized into two main folders: `search_algorithms` and `sort_algorithms`. Each file demonstrates a specific algorithm with example usage.

## Folder Structure

- **search_algorithms/**
  - Contains search algorithms and related utilities.
- **sort_algorithms/**
  - Contains various sorting algorithm implementations.

## File Descriptions

### search_algorithms/
- **binary_search.cpp**
  - Implements the binary search algorithm to efficiently find an element in a sorted array. Also includes a selection sort function to sort the array before searching, and a demonstration in the `main` function.

### sort_algorithms/
- **bubble_sort.cpp**
  - Implements the bubble sort algorithm, which repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Includes a demonstration in the `main` function.
- **insertion_sort.cpp**
  - Implements the insertion sort algorithm, which builds the sorted array one item at a time by comparing each new element to those already sorted. Includes a demonstration in the `main` function.
- **merge_sort.cpp**
  - Implements the merge sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer sorting technique that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. Includes a demonstration in the `main` function.
- **Selection Sort.cpp**
  - Implements the selection sort algorithm, which repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the beginning. Includes a demonstration in the `main` function.

## How to Use

1. Open any `.cpp` file in your preferred C++ IDE or editor.
2. Compile and run the file to see the algorithm in action.
3. You can modify the input arrays in the `main` functions to test with different data.
